# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction
Machine Learning Explainability for Santander Customer Transaction Prediction using SHAP and Partial Dependence Plot


In this challenge, we need to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
Also, this is a Binary Classification Problem under Supervised Machine Learning algorithms.

Training data consists of 2,00,000 observations and 200 numerical anonymous predictor features, target variable and transaction_ID with no missing values.
